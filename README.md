## Welcome
Diabetes has always been a problem to many people. Diabetes Mellitus is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called your blood sugar is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.
SNF (SayNoFeast) is a webapp that acts as a diabetes predictor. Features include an awareness video about diabetes, a sixty second risk test by the ADA, an FAQ section about the most asked questions and finally, we have a register section where you fill in your details and a report will be downloaded with the details of your report.
